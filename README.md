## My process

In creating this, I decided that I wanted to attempt to make this using vanilla javascript and not a framework.
Now that I have completed the process, I feel like I could go back with a clearer mind of the overall scope and work to be done to clean up my work and have it be a bit clearer to follow through.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
